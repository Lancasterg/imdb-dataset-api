# IMDB dataset API

A simple API for serving the [50,000 tv and web shows](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muralidharbhusal/50000-tv-and-web-shows) dataset. For simplicity and speed, the data is served from memory. 

Some testing has been done, however there is no guarantee that this code will work. This API was written in an evening to refresh my memory of Java. 

Requests can be made to the following endpoints: 
- searchByTitle
- searchByMinRating
